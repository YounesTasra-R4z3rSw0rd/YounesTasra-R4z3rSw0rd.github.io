Log in as the admin and capture the flag! If you can...<br/>
The server is listening on port ``1337`` via TCP. You can connect to it using ``Netcat`` or any other tool you prefer.

### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Source Code</font></strong>**
##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">encrypt_data() function:</font></strong>**

```python
def encrypt_data(data,key,iv):
    padded = pad(data.encode(),16,style='pkcs7')
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC,iv)
    enc = cipher.encrypt(padded)
    return enc.hex()
```

* This function takes 3 parameters: `data`, `key` and `iv` and performs encryption on the `data` using AES *Advanced Encryption Standard* cipher in *Cipher Block Chaining* mode.
* The resulting ciphertext is returned in Hexadecimal representation.

##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">decrypt_data() function:</font></strong>**
```python
def decrypt_data(encryptedParams,key,iv):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC,iv)
    paddedParams = cipher.decrypt( unhexlify(encryptedParams))
    if b'admin&password=sUp3rPaSs1' in unpad(paddedParams,16,style='pkcs7'):
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
```
* This function takes the encrypted data, key and IV as input, decrypts the data using `AES-CBC` mode and checks if *`admin&password=sUp3rPaSs1`* is present in the decrypted data.
* The function returns ``1`` if the condition is met, and `0` otherwise.

##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">setup() function:</font></strong>**
```python
def setup(server,username,password,key,iv):
        message = 'access_username=' + username +'&password=' + password
        send_message(server, "Leaked ciphertext: " + encrypt_data(message,key,iv)+'\n')
        send_message(server,"enter ciphertext: ")

        enc_message = server.recv(4096).decode().strip()

        try:
                check = decrypt_data(enc_message,key,iv)
        except Exception as e:
                send_message(server, str(e) + '\n')
                server.close()

        if check:
                send_message(server, 'No way! You got it!\nA nice flag for you: '+ flag)
                server.close()
        else:
                send_message(server, 'Flip off!')
                server.close()
```
* This function handles the setup phase of the communication between the server and the client. Here's an overview of what the function does:
1. It constructs the data to be encrypted using the function `encrypt_data()` in the string variable `message` by combining the user-provided `username` and `password`. The resulting string follows the format `access_username=<username>&password=<password>`
2. It encrypts the content of the string variable `message` and sends the resulting ciphertext to the user.
3. It sends a request to the client to enter the ciphertext, and attempts to decrypt the received ciphertext by calling the ``decrypt_data()`` function. If the decrypt function returns ``1``, a success message is sent along with the flag. Otherwise, a failure message is displayed. 

##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">start() function:</font></strong>**
```python
def start(server):
        key = get_random_bytes(16)
        iv = get_random_bytes(16)
        send_message(server, 'Welcome! Please login as the admin!\n')
        send_message(server, 'username: ')
        username = server.recv(4096).decode().strip()

        send_message(server, username +"'s password: ")
        password = server.recv(4096).decode().strip()

        message = 'access_username=' + username +'&password=' + password

        if "admin&password=sUp3rPaSs1" in message:
            send_message(server, 'Not that easy :)\nGoodbye!\n')
        else:
            setup(server,username,password,key,iv)
```
* This function sets up the initial communication with the client/user, retrieves the username and password from the client, constructs the data to be encrypted in the string variable `message` and checks if `admin&password=sUp3rPaSs1` is a substring of the string `message`. If it's the case, an error message is returned. Otherwise, the ``setup()`` function is executed.

***

**In summary**, the user is prompted to provide a ``username`` and ``password``. These credentials are combined into a string with the format ``access_username=<username>&password=<password>``. If the substring ``admin&password=sUp3rPaSs1`` is not found within the constructed message, it will be encrypted using the ``AES`` cipher in ``CBC`` mode *(``AES-CBC-128``)*. The resulting ciphertext is then returned to the user. The user is then asked to input a ciphertext for decryption, and the decrypted plaintext is checked for the presence of the substring ``admin&password=sUp3rPaSs1``. If this substring is found, a flag will be returned.<br/>

### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">AES-CBC vulnerability:</font></strong>** 
##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">AES-CBC mode:</font></strong>**

AES, short for **Advanced Encryption Standard**, is a `128-bit symmetric bloc cipher`, which means that it takes 128 bits of plaintext and encrypts it into 128 bits of ciphertext with a key that can either be `128`, `192` or `256` bits.<br/>
In `CBC` mode, each block of plaintext is [XORed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR) with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted.
In other words, `CBC` mode links the output of one block to the input of the next block, which essentially `randomise` the encryption and hence generate distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times.<br/>
For the first block, we use something called an `Initialization Vector` (IV), which is nothing more than a `random array of bytes` that has the same length of the blocks.<br/>

<center><i>AES-CBC | Encryption</i></center>
<br/>

`Decryption` works by doing the process in `reverse`. <br/>
As you can see in the representation below, the first ciphertext block is decrypted using the decryption key _(which is the same key used for encryption since we are working with symmetric encryption)_ and XORing the result with the `Initialization Vector` (IV), which gives us the first plaintext block.<br/>
Now, moving to the next block, we decrypt the second ciphertext block and `XOR` the result with the previous ciphertext block which gives us the second plaintext block, and so on …<br/>

<br/>

##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Bit Flipping Attack:</font></strong>**
Now that we understand how `CBC` works, we can now talk about `Bit-Flipping` attack.<br/>
The main vulnerable part of `CBC` is that, it relies on the previous ciphertext block in order to encrypt/decrypt the next plaintext/ciphertext block, and this exactly where the `Bit-Flipping` attack comes into play.<br/>
Let’s view the below visual representation of this attack in order to better understand how it works:<br/>

<center><i>Bit Flipping Process</i></center>

* As you can see, a <strong><font color="Red">1-bit error</font></strong> in the second ciphertext block :
    - Completely scrambles the <strong><font color="Red">plaintext block</font></strong> which has the same index as the modified ciphertext,
    - AND Generates the same <strong><font color="Red">1-bit error</font></strong> in the next plaintext block (Third block).
* For example, in order to flip the <strong><font color="Red">first bit</font></strong> of the `third plaintext block`, we need to flip the <strong><font color="Red">first bit</font></strong> of the `second ciphertext block`.


### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Exploitation:</font></strong>**
##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">The attack:</font></strong>**
Since we have knowledge of the plaintext structure being encrypted with ``AES-CBC`` mode, along with the resulting ciphertext (`Leaked ciphertext`) and we know the condition that needs to be met in order to get the flag, we can perform the ``Bit Flipping`` attack, by manipulating a specific parts of the leaked ciphertext so that the string `admin&password=sUp3rPaSs1` would be part of the decrypted data.

##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Weaponization:</font></strong>**
To carry out the attack, we can construct a payload with intentionally misspelled characters, such as `access_username=bdmin&password=sUp3rPaSs1&password=password` (Note the purposeful misspelling of `admin` as `bdmin`). Next, we manipulate the ciphertext by modifying the previous block so that the `b` at the misspelled index is changed to `a`.<br/>
To do so, we input `bdmin&password=sUp3rPaSs1` as the username and choose any desired value (not necessarily `password`) for the password field, so that the resulting ``message`` would be `access_username=bdmin&password=sUp3rPaSs1&password=password` as planned.

Refer to the provided representation below for a better understanding of the encryption process:
<br/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-flip/CBC-Encrypt.png" alt="">
<center><i>Encryption process</i></center>

* As you can see, the message `access_username=bdmin&password=sUp3rPaSs1&password=password` is partitioned into 16-bytes blocks, and the misspelled character '`b`' is placed in the first byte of the second plaintext block. Therefore, to replace '`b`' with '`a`', we must manipulate the first byte of the preceding block, which corresponds to the first block in the sequence. The following representation illustrates this manipulation:

<br/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-flip/CBC-Decrypt.png" alt="">
<center><i>Decryption process</i></center>

* As you can see, by performing the bit flipping process on the first byte of the previous block (``Block 1``), the first byte '`b`' of the second block (Block 2) is replaced with '`a`', as planned.

##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Executing the attack using Python:</font></strong>**
The following code perform the Bit Flipping attack on the first byte of the first ciphertext block:
```python
# Flipping the first byte of the first ciphertext block so that 'b' in the second plaintext block "bdmin&password=sUp3rPaSs1" becomes 'a' -> "admin&password=sUp3rPaSs1"
xor = ord('b') ^ ord('a')
flipped = hex(int(leaked_ciphertext[0:2], 16) ^ xor)[2:]
ciphertext = flipped.encode("utf-8") + leaked_ciphertext[2:]
```
* This code flips the first byte of the first block of the leaked ciphertext, changing '`b`' to '`a`' in the second plaintext block. This manipulation is done using XOR operations. Next, it constructs the modified ciphertext by combining the flipped byte with the remaining leaked ciphertext.
