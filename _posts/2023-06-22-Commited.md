<center><strong><font color="DarkGray"><a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/committed" target="_blank"><er>Committed</er></a> is a machine from TryHackMe where there is a zip folder that contains a Git repository requiring investigation for a possible leak of sensitive code</font></strong></center>

### **<strong><font color="Brown">Challenge Description</font></strong>**
***
Oh no, not again! One of our developers accidentally committed some sensitive code to our GitHub repository. Well, at least, that is what they told us... the problem is, we don't remember what or where! Can you track down what we accidentally committed?

### **<strong><font color="Brown">Write-Up</font></strong>**
***
#### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Downloading the files locally:</font></strong>**
The files we need are located in `/home/ubuntu/commited` on the VM attached to this task. Let's start a python webserver on this attached VM in order to download the `commited.zip` zip file into our local machine:
```bash
python3 -m http.server <PORT>
```

<center><i>Python web server on port 1234</i></center>
<br/>

Now, on our local machine, let's download the hosted file `commited.zip`:
```bash
wget http://<MACHINE_IP>:<PORT>/commited.zip
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-committed/2023-06-21 17_38_48-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Downloading commited.zip file</i></center>
<br/>

Let's extract the content of the zip file we downloaded `commited.zip`:
```shell
unzip commited.zip
```

<center><i>Extracted folder</i></center>
<br/>

* Now we have access to the Git repository and we can start enumerating it locally.

#### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">GitTools - Extractor:</font></strong>**
As you can see from the screenshot above, there is a `.git` folder inside the folder we extracted `commited`. With that, we can use the `Extractor` tool from [GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools#extractor) in order to extract all the commits from the `.git` folder.
To do so, let's follow the below steps:

**1-** Clone the repository:
<br/>

<center><i>Cloning GotTools repo</i></center>
<br/>

**2-** cd into ``GitTools/Extractor`` folder copy and paste the bash script `extractor.sh` in the directory of the `commited` folder:
<br/>

<center><i>Copying Extractor bash script</i></center>

<center><i>extractor.sh</i></center>
<br/>

**3-** Run the extractor script:
```bash
./extractor.sh commited/ new_commited/
```

<center><i>Executing the extractor tool</i></center>
<br/>

* This command will extract all the commits from ``commited/.git/`` folder and stores them in `new_commited/` folder:

<center><i>Commits</i></center>
<br/>

* As you can see, there are 9 commits in total, each is represented with a folder that contains some text files.

#### **<strong><font color="DarkCyan">Flag:</font></strong>**
Now, all we need to do is to search for the flag, which is most likely in the format `flag{}`
<br/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-committed/2023-06-21 18_43_27-TryHackMe _ Committed — Mozilla Firefox.png" alt="">
<center><i>Flag format</i></center>
<br/>

##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Using Grep:</font></strong>**
We can run the following command, which will perform a recursive search in the `new_commited` directory for any occurrences of the string `flag`, by searching through all files within the commit directories.
```bash
grep -Ri 'flag'
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-committed/2023-06-21 18_46_48-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>grep -Ri 'flag'</i></center>
<br/>

##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Using a loop:</font></strong>**
We can use a nested loop to iterate through files in the directory structure under the `new_commited` folder.
<br/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-committed/2023-06-21 18_47_33-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Flag using for loop</i></center>
<br/>

* This command will search through all the files within `new_commited` directory and its subdirectories, by looking for lines that contain the pattern `{.*}` and displays the matching lines on the terminal.
* As you can guess, this method is useful if we don't have a previous knowledge on the flag's format. Of course, we could've done the same thing with the first method `grep` by running the command: 
```bash
grep -RiE {.*}
```

<center><i>grep -RiE {.*}</i></center>

##### **<strong><font color="DarkKhaki">Using a git-cola tool:</font></strong>**
``git-cola`` is an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) for the Git version control system. It provides a more user-friendly and visually appealing interface compared to the command-line interface provided by ``Git``
* Installation:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git-cola
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd.github.io/main/assets/img/thm-committed/2023-06-22 19_52_22-HACKING_MACHINE - VMware Workstation 17 Player (Non-commercial use only).png" alt="">
<center><i>Installing git-cola</i></center>
<br/>

* You can start enumerating the repository using ``git-cola`` by following the bellow steps:
1. Run the command ``git-cola`` in terminal,
2. Click on the `New..` button,
3. Select the `new_commited` folder (the folder that contains the commits extracted using `GitTools-Extractor`),
4. Click on `Open`,

<center><i>Setting up git-cola</i></center>
<br/>

* After opening the folder, you can start enumerating each commits, by going through each and every file while inspecting the `Diff` window below, until you find your flag.
